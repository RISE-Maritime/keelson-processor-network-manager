# Keelson Processor WHOAMI

Keelson processor for requesting platform configuration and data link tester

## Functions (TODO:)

- [ ] Query: Ping, Time stamps and directly return incoming message
- [ ] Run: Classing Ping test on selected amount and interval, (lowest possible latency)
- [ ] Run: Message size test on selected from X MB up to X MB on set interval, pub result

- [ ] SubPub: Ping, Time stamps and directly return incoming message
- [ ] Pub: Alarm
- [ ] Query: Trigger Ping test
- [ ] Query: Message size test
- [ ] Query: Providing platform description and configuration


## Quick start

```bash
python3 bin/main.py --log-level 10 --realm rise --entity-id masslab
```

## System configuration

Computer should have timeserver NTP configured to **ntp.se**

## Get going with development

Setup for development environment on your own computer:

1) Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   - Docker desktop will provide you with an UI for monitoring and controlling docker containers and images along debugging 
   - If you want to learn more about docker and its building blocks of images and containers checkout [Docker quick hands-on in guide](https://docs.docker.com/guides/get-started/)
2) Start up of **Zenoh router** either in your computer or any other computer within your local network 

   ```bash
    # Navigate to folder containing docker-compose.zenoh-router.yml
  
    # Start router with log output 
    docker-compose -f containing docker-compose.zenoh-router.yml up

    # If no obvious errors, stop container "ctrl-c"

    # Start container and let it run in the background/detached (append -d) 
    docker-compose -f containing docker-compose.zenoh-router.yml up -d
   ```

    [Link to --> docker-compose.zenoh-router.yml](docker-compose.zenoh-router.yml)

1) Now the Zenoh router is hopefully running in the background and should be available on localhost:8000. This can be example tested with [Zenoh Rest API ](https://zenoh.io/docs/apis/rest/) or continue to next step running Python API
2) Set up python virtual environment  `python >= 3.11`
   1) Install package `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3)  Now you are ready to explore some example scripts in the [exploration folder](./exploration/) 
    1)  Sample are coming from:
         -   [Zenoh Python API ](https://zenoh-python.readthedocs.io/en/0.10.1-rc/#quick-start-examples)
